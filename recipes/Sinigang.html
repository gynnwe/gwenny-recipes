    <h4>What could possibly be disliked about pork sinigang or the dish in general? I grew up loving all of its
        iterations and variations. People continue to prepare this popular Filipino dish because of some component in
        it. Personally, I enjoy the way the hot, sour broth makes me feel. I feel warm and cozy because of it while it's
        cold outside. On hot summer days, it still has the same calming effect on me, but for some reason, the warm soup
        almost literally makes me feel chilly.</h4>

    <h4>My mother was not fond of cooking Sinigang when I was a child. Although preparing this meal is a
        once-in-a-blue-moon occurrence, the pork sinigang's sour flavor made me gain interest in making it. As the go-to
        girl who purchases ingredients every time my mom cooks, I once tried purchasing Pork Sinigang ingredients also
        and cooked the meal on my own. Turns out, it was good! My Filipino heart feels fulfilled.</h4>
